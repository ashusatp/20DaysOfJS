############## Linked List #############
[+] A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes
[+] Each node consists of a data value and pointer that points to the next node 
[+] The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without rellocation or reorganization of the    entire structure 
[+] Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity.
[+] The linked list data structure supports three main operations
    [+] Insertion -  to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the list
    [+] Deletion - to remove an item given its index or value
    [+] Search - to find an element given its value


############## Linked List #############
[+] It can be used to implement both stacks and queue
[+] All applications of both stacks and queues are applications of linked lists
