########### Queue ############

[+] The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO)
[+] The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed
[+] A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end(front/head).
[+] The Queue data structure supports two main operations(both have constant time complexity)
    [+] Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection.
    [+] Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection.
