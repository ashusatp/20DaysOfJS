############ Hash Table ##############

[+] A hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that is used to store key-value pairs
[+] Given a key, we can associate a value with that key for very fast lookup
[+] JavaScript's Object is a special implementation of the hash table data structure. However, Object class adds its own keys. Keys that you input may conflict and overwrite the inherited default properties.
[+] Maps which were introduced in 2015 allow us to store key-value pairs


############ Hash Table Contd. ###############

[+] Hash table stores keyn value pair
    'in' => 'india'
    'au' => 'Australia'

[+] We store the key value pairs in a fixed sized array
[+] Array have a numeric index
[+] How do we go from using a string as an index to number as an index?
    [+] A hashing function accepts the string key, conversts it into a hash code using defined logic and then maps it into a numeric index that is with in the bounds of the Array
    [+] Using the index,store the value
    [+] The same hashing function is reused to retrieve the value given a key 
[+] Operations
    [+] Set to store a key-value pair
    [+] Get to retrieve a value given its key
    [+] Remove to delete a key value pair
