Objects V/S map

[+] Objects are unordered whereas maps are ordered
[+] Keys in objects can only be string or symbol type whereas in maps, they can be of any type.
[+] An object has a prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you are not careful. A map on the other hand does not contain any keys by default.
[+] Objects are not iterable whreas maps are iterable
[+] The number of items in an object must be determined manually where as it is readily available with the size property in a map.
[+] Apart from storing data, you can attach functionality to an object whereas maps are resticted to just storing data.
